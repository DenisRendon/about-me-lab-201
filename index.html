  3. I can make some mean fajita tacos!<br>
  4. I enjoy the outdoors with my 3 year old daughter, we go hiking, camping and she is getting the hang of using a fishing rod now.I think I enjoy it even more because she wont let her mom come because its our time togther, <em>and I didnt even have to teach her that!</em><br>
  5. A goal of mine to to succeed in this course all the way through 401, land an awsome remote position with a company I believe in. Move to Maine and buy a cape cod house with a good amount of land. Ill enjoy the freshest lobster anytime I want, plently of hunting and just a different type of life than the city where I am now. Im ready to go back to the slower pace and enjoy my time with my family.
